# Calling an extension
{: #call-extension}

An extension is an integration with an external service. By calling an extension from an action, your assistant can send requests to the external service and receive response data it can use in the conversation.
{: shortdesc}

For example, you might use an extension to interact with a ticketing or customer relationship management (CRM) system, or to retrieve real-time data such as mortgage rates or weather conditions. Response data from the extension is then available as action variables, which your assistant can use in the conversation.

For information about how to build a custom extension, see [Build a custom extension](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-build-custom-extension).

To call a custom extension from an action:

1. In the action editor, create or open the step from which you want to call the extension.

1. In the step editor, click **And then**.

1. Click **Use an extension**.

1. In the **Extension setup** window, specify the following information:

    - In the **Extension** field, select the extension you want to call.

    - In the **Operation** field, select the operation you want to perform.

1. Specify values for each of the input parameters that will be sent to the extension. To assign a value to a parameter, click the input field for the value:

    - Select a session variable or assistant variable to use its value.

    - Select **Expression** to write an expression to define the value for the session variable. For more information about expressions, see [Writing expressions](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-expressions).
