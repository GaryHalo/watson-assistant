# Welcome to the new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}
{: #welcome-new-assistant}

Welcome to the documentation for the new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}!
{: shortdesc}

The new {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} experience, focused on using **actions** to build customer conversations, is designed to make it simple enough for *anyone* to build a virtual assistant. Building, testing,  publishing, and analyzing your assistant can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.

- New **navigation** provides a workflow for building, previewing, publishing, and analyzing your assistant. 

- Each assistant has a **home page** with a task list to help you get started.

- Build conversations with **actions**, which represent the tasks you want your assistant to help your customers with. Each action contains a series of steps that represent individual exchanges with a customer.

- A new way to **publish** lets you review and debug your work in a draft environment before going live to your customers.

- Use a new suite of **analytics** to improve your assistant. Review which actions are being completed to see what your customers want help with, determine if your assistant understands and addresses customer needs, and decide how can you make your assistant better.

For more information about the new experience, see [FAQs about the new IBM Watson Assistant experience](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-watson-assistant-faqs#faqs-new-experience).

## Switching the experience
{: #welcome-new-assistant-switch-experience}

You can easily switch back and forth between the new experience and the classic experience. However, the new experience provides an simplified user interface, an improved deployment process, and access to the latest features. For more information, see [Migrating to the new experience](/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-migrate-overview).

To switch between the new and classic experiences, following these steps:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} interface, click the **Manage** ![Manage icon](images/user-icon.png) icon to open your account menu.

1. Select **Switch to new experience** or **Switch to classic experience** from the account menu.

1. Click **Switch** to confirm that you want to start using the new experience.

You won't lose any work if you switch to a different experience, and other users of the same instance are not affected. However, keep in mind that any work you do in one experience is not available in the other experience. You can switch back and forth at any time.
