# Web chat overview
{: #web-chat-overview}

You can use the web chat integration to deploy your assistant on your website without writing any code. The web chat can help your customers start the conversation with common questions or tasks; it can display multimedia and interactive elements such as forms, and it can transfer customers to human agents for more help.
{: shortdesc}

For each assistant, the web chat integration provides a preconfigured JavaScript code snippet that you can copy and paste into any web page where you want users to be able to interact with the assistant. This script creates an instance of the web chat widget, saving you the time and effort that would be required to build your own custom user interface.

## Why use the web chat?

Building a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, and validate input. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.

The web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use it is secure and supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.

The web chat is also extensively customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).

The following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.
