# Managing access
{: #access-control}

If you need to collaborate with others on your assistants, you can use the [Identity and Access Management (IAM) page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/users) in IBM Cloud to add users.
{: shortdesc}

In the new Watson Assistant, each assistant contains all the draft and live resolution methods (actions and search integration) and channels you add (such as web chat, Facebook, or Slack), so the simplest way to provide access is to add users to your Watson Assistant instance with Administrator and Manager permissions. This gives other users the same level of access to a Watson Assistant service instance as you, and ensures they have all the privileges they need to build and deploy any assistant. Unlike classic Watson Assistant, you no longer need to provide specific access to individual assistants and skills. Now in the new Watson Assistant, each assistant includes everything you need and access is more efficient.
